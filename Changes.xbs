Changes to the xbs program


06.09.97 The program now plots additional straight lines,
         typically the edges of the unit cell. 
         Input in the .bs file is like this:

            line    0.0 0.0 0.0   1.0 0.0 0.0

         Plotting of the lines (continuous, dashed or off) is
         toggled by key L (that is: shift-l) in the program.
